# Python data processing

## Courses Context
I decided to enroll into 2-pack course of data processing with Python. When I took this courses I already had almost 10 years of experience with Python as programming language since my days at University of Santiago. Also, I had some work experience with Python in my prevoius jobs. 

As a Software Engineer with Computer Sciense formation through this courses I could revisit again the fundamentals of Python and basic and intermediate data analysis.

### Course 1: Python programming tools for data processing

Course goal: Learn and apply basic programming tools focused in data processing

### Course 2: Python for data handling: intermediate

Course goal: Learn and apply advanced data processing tools and techniques in professional environments. Gather skills to facilitate analysis tasks completion and problem solving.

## What to expect from this repo?
In this repository you will find exercises made in the context of my 2 courses.

You will find all the instructions to clone, run the environment and check the results of the basic and intermediate exercises of the course.

## Skills

- Programming (codding) in Python language
- Use of basic and advanced mathematical tools and techniques to process data
- Critical thinking to transform data into information
- Gather knowledge from the resulting information transformation process
- Solve problems with real world data

## Instructions to check results

### Run Jupiter Notebook from Github

### Run Jupyter Notebook from local Jupyter Server

#### Prerequisitos

- Installed ```python``` version (I used ```pyenv 2.6.3``` to install global version of ```python 3.12.11```)

### Run Jupyter Notebook from Visual Studio Code
